# 💎 Diamond Price Prediction API

This project provides an API interface for predicting diamond prices using machine learning. The system was developed around a dataset of diamond features, trained with a predictive model, and deployed with a focus on usability and future scalability.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Train/Test Split**: Data was divided into training and test sets to evaluate performance.
- **Model Deployment**: A machine learning model was trained and stored using `pickle` for persistence.
- **JSON Integration**: All data (train, test, predictions) was unified and stored in JSON format for easy access and manipulation.
- **API Routes**: Several endpoints are defined to:
  - Serve the data (Train, Test, Predictions)
  - Filter diamonds by **Color** and **Cut**
- **Interactive Demo**: Connected to a front-end or visualization through [Gamma.app](https://gamma.app) for querying and testing.

---

## 📦 Tech Stack

- **Python** for data processing and backend
- **Pandas** for data manipulation
- **Scikit-learn** (assumed from context) for modeling
- **Pickle** for model serialization
- **JSON** for unified data structure
- **API Framework** (e.g., Flask or FastAPI, likely used but not explicitly mentioned)

---

## 🔮 Possible Future Uses

- **E-commerce Integration**: Powering diamond price calculators or recommendation engines in online jewelry stores.
- **Market Analysis Tools**: Assisting businesses in identifying price trends based on diamond attributes.
- **Educational Platforms**: Teaching regression models and API development with real-world data.
- **Advanced Filtering**: Incorporate filters beyond color and cut, like clarity, carat, or certification body.
- **Model Updates**: Support retraining with new data over time for improved accuracy.
